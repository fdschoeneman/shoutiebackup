Terms of Service
Last Updated on July 21, 2010

These terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service") govern your access to and use of Yelp's websites and mobile applications that link to or reference these Terms of Service (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service and concluding a legally binding contract with Yelp! Inc. ("Yelp"). Do not access or use the Service if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by the Terms of Service.

DEFINITIONS
Parties
"You" and "your" refer to you, as a user of the Service. A "user" is someone who accesses, browses, crawls, scrapes, or in any way uses the Service. "We", "us", and "our" refer to Yelp.

Content
"Content" means text, images, photos, audio, video, location data, and all other forms of data or communication. "Your Content" means Content that you submit or transmit to, through, or in connection with the Service, such as ratings, reviews, compliments, invitations, check-ins, messages, and information that you publicly display or displayed in your account profile. "User Content" means Content that users submit or transmit to, through, or in connection with the Service. "Yelp Content" means Content that we create and make available in connection with the Service. "Third Party Content" means Content that originates from parties other than Yelp or its users, which is made available in connection with the Service. "Site Content" means all of the Content that is made available in connection with the Service, including Your Content, User Content, Third Party Content, and Yelp Content.

CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE
We may modify the Terms of Service from time to time. When changes are made, we will notify you by making the revised version available on this webpage, and will indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last made. You should revisit these Terms of Service on a regular basis as revised versions will be binding on you. Any such modification will be effective upon our posting of new Terms of Service. You understand and agree that your continued access to or use of the Service after any posted modification to the Terms of Service indicates your acceptance of the modification.

TRANSLATION
We may translate these Terms of Service into other languages for your convenience. Nevertheless, the English version governs your relationship with Yelp, and any inconsistencies among the different versions will be resolved in favor of the English version.

USING THE SERVICE
Eligibility
To access or use the Service, you must be 18 years or older and have the requisite power and authority to enter into these Terms of Service. You may not access or use the Service if you are a competitor of ours or if we have previously banned you from the Service or closed your account.

Permission to Use the Service
We grant you permission to use the Service subject to the restrictions in these Terms of Service. Your use of the Service is at your own risk, including the risk that you might be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate.

Site Availability
The Service may be modified, updated, interrupted, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice or liability.

User Accounts
You must create an account and provide certain information about yourself in order to use some of the features that are offered through the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password. You are also responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We reserve the right to close your account at any time for any or no reason.

There are two types of accounts:

A "Personal Account" is an account for your personal, non-commercial use only. In creating a Personal Account, we ask that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself to bolster your credibility as a contributor to the Service. You may not impersonate someone else (e.g., adopt the identity of a celebrity or your next-door neighbor), create or use an account for anyone other than yourself, provide an email address other than your own, or create multiple Personal Accounts. If you use a pseudonym, take care to note that others may still be able to identify you if, for example, you include identifying information in your reviews, use the same account information on other sites, or allow other sites to share information about you with Yelp. Please read our Privacy Policy for more information.

A "Business Account" is an account to be used solely for the purpose of representing your business in connection with the Service. In creating or updating a Business Account, you must be an authorized representative of the business in question, and you must provide complete and accurate information about yourself and the business you represent, including an unobstructed photo of yourself to be displayed in connection with your Business Account. You may not provide an email address that is not your own. If you are no longer an authorized representative of the business in question, you must close your Business Account immediately.

Communications from Yelp and other Users
By creating an account, you agree to receive certain communications in connection with the Service. For example, you might receive compliments or friend requests from other Users. You will also receive our weekly e-mail newsletter about happenings in your neighborhood. You can opt-out of non-essential communications here

CONTENT
Responsibility for Your Content
You alone are responsible for Your Content, and once published, it cannot always be withdrawn. You assume all risks associated with Your Content, including anyone's reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability, or any disclosure by you of information in Your Content that makes you personally identifiable. You represent that you own, or have the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of Your Content as described herein. You may not imply that Your Content is in any way sponsored or endorsed by Yelp.

You may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your Content contains material that is false, intentionally misleading, or defamatory; violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; contains material that is unlawful, including illegal hate speech or pornography; exploits or otherwise harms minors; or violates or advocates the violation of any law or regulation.

Our Right to Use Your Content
We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, distributing it, and allowing others to do the same in connection with their own websites and media platforms ("Other Media"). As such, you hereby irrevocably grant us world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable rights to use Your Content for any purpose. You also irrevocably grant the users of the Service and any Other Media the right to access Your Content in connection with their use of the Service and any Other Media. Finally, you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Yelp and its users any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content. By "use" we mean use, copy, publicly perform or display, distribute, modify, translate, and create derivative works of Your Content.

Ownership
As between you and Yelp, you own Your Content. We own the Yelp Content, including but not limited to visual interfaces, interactive features, graphics, design, compilation, computer code, products, software, aggregate user review ratings, and all other elements and components of the Service excluding Your Content, User Content and Third Party Content. We also own the copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and other intellectual and proprietary rights throughout the world (the "IP Rights") associated with the Yelp Content and the Service, which are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, trademark laws and all other applicable intellectual and proprietary rights and laws. As such, you may not modify, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works or adaptations of, publicly display or in any way exploit any of the Yelp Content in whole or in part except as expressly authorized by us. Except as expressly and unambiguously provided herein, we do not grant you any express or implied rights, and all rights in and to the Service and the Yelp Content are retained by us.

Advertising
Yelp and its licensees may publicly display advertisements and other information adjacent to or included with Your Content. You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.

Content Feeds
We make some of the Site Content (the "Feed Content") available via Real Simple Syndication and Atom feeds (the "Feeds"). You may access and use the Feeds in order to display Feed Content on your personal computer, website, or blog ("Your Site"), provided that (i) your use of the Feeds is for personal, non-commercial purposes only, (ii) your display of the Feed Content links back to the relevant pages on Yelp's websites, and attributes Yelp as the source of the Feed Content, (iii) your use or display of the Feed Content does not suggest that Yelp promotes or endorses any third party causes, ideas, websites, products or services, including Your Site, (iv) you do not redistribute the Feed Content, and (v) your use of the Feeds does not overburden Yelp's systems. Yelp reserves all rights in the Feed Content and may terminate the Feeds at any time. Please select "Partnerships" on our contacts page here to inquire about other possible uses of the Feeds.

Other
We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate User Content from time to time at our sole discretion and without notice to you. For example, we may remove a review if we believe it violates our Content Guidelines. We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content, nor do we guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Your Content.

RESTRICTIONS
We are under no obligation to enforce the Terms of Service on your behalf against another user. While we encourage you to let us know if you believe another user has violated the Terms of Service, we reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action at our sole discretion.

in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using
particular craigslist services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted
guidelines for all craigslist services, which may change from time to time.
Should you object to any term or condition of the TOU, any guidelines,
or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with craigslist
in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of craigslist.
craigslist has the right, but is not obligated, to strictly enforce the TOU
through self-help, community moderation, active investigation, litigation and
prosecution.


2. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise
alter these terms and conditions at any time.  Such modifications shall become
effective immediately upon the posting thereof. You must review this agreement
on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes. You can find the
most recent version of the TOU at:

http://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.html


3. CONTENT

You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos,
video, sounds, or other materials ("Content") posted on, transmitted
through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the
person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are
entirely responsible for each individual item ("Item") of Content that you
post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that
craigslist does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available
through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to
Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise
objectionable. Furthermore, the craigslist site and Content available through
the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely
independent of craigslist.  craigslist makes no representation or warranty as
to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained
in any such site.  Your linking to any other webites is at your own risk.
You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the
use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no
circumstances will craigslist be liable in any way for any Content or for
any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content
posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge
that craigslist does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that craigslist
shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to
refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for
violating the letter or spirit of the TOU or for any other reason.


4. THIRD PARTY CONTENT, SITES, AND SERVICES

The craigslist site and Content available through the Service may contain
features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access
to third party content which is completely independent of craigslist,
including web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information
and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services,
and the Internet as a whole.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through
the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any
other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such
dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.
You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate
before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these
third parties.

You agree that craigslist shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or
damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is
a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third
party, you understand and agree that craigslist is under no obligation to
become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other
users, you hereby release craigslist, its officers, employees, agents and
successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and
unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related
to such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you
waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does
not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."


5.  NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT

otherwise violated, please notify craigslist's agent for notice of claims of

California Business and Professions Code.  Such violations may subject the

10. PAID POSTINGS

We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee
is an access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area.

and compliance with the TOU. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the
event that Content is removed from the Service for violating the TOU.


11. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE

You acknowledge that craigslist may establish limits concerning use of the
Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained
by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or

frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that craigslist

12. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE

craigslist grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access
the Service for your own personal use.  This license does not include:
(a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection,
aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service
nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and
extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by craigslist.
A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search
engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather
information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service,
provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses
using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file.
"General purpose internet search engine" does not include a website or
search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings
or in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale,
services, or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified
ad listing services.

craigslist permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink
on your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use
is for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in
personal web blogs or personal online media).  If the total number of such
postings displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100)
postings, your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOU,
absent express permission granted by craigslist to do so.  You may also
create a hyperlink to the home page of craigslist sites so long as the
link does not portray craigslist, its employees, or its affiliates in a
false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.

craigslist offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users
can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings
through third party software news aggregators.  craigslist permits you to
display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website
or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for
personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked
back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the
post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS
feed, proper attribution to 'craigslist' as the source, (d) your use or
display does not suggest that craigslist promotes or endorses any third
party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not
redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden
craigslist's systems.  craigslist reserves all rights in the content of
the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.

Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by
craigslist immediately terminates said permission or license.  In order to
collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the
the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other
purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first
obtain a license from craigslist.


13. TERMINATION OF SERVICE

You agree that craigslist, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not
the obligation) to delete or deactivate your account, block your email or IP
address, or otherwise terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any
part thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any
Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation,
if craigslist believes that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or
spirit of the TOU. Further, you agree that craigslist shall not be liable
to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination.
Sections 2, 4, 6 and 10-16 shall survive termination of the TOU.

18. GENERAL INFORMATION

The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and craigslist and
govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you
and craigslist. The TOU and the relationship between you and craigslist
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
its conflict of law provisions. You and craigslist agree to submit to the
personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county
of San Francisco, California. The failure of craigslist to exercise or
enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of
such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in
full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to
the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use
of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such
claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.


19. VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

Please report any violations of the TOU, by flagging the posting(s) for
review, or by emailing to:

abuse@craigslist.org

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our
right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify,
if it becomes necessary for craigslist to pursue legal action to enforce these
Terms, you will be liable to pay craigslist the following amounts as liquidated
damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of craigslists' damages for
the specified breaches of these Terms:

a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2)
falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about
another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay
craigslist one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message.
This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful non-deceptive
parody of public figures.

b. If craigslist establishes limits on the frequency with which you may
access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you
agree to pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted
in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access craigslist in
excess of such limits, whichever is higher.

c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to craigslist email
addresses or through craigslist computer systems, you agree to pay
craigslist twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email.

d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described
above, you agree to pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each
Item of Content posted.  In its sole discretion, craigslist may elect
to issue a warning before assessing damages.

e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the
TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to
pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every Item you post
in violation of the TOU.  A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of
the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the
"Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in
violation of the TOU) agrees to pay craigslist an additional one hundred
dollars ($100) for each Item posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of
the Principal in violation of the TOU.

f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise
exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in
violation of these Terms without craigslist's express written permission,
you agree to pay craigslist three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day
on which you engage in such conduct.

Otherwise, you agree to pay craigslist's actual damages, to the extent such
actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other
provision of these Terms, craigslist retains the right to seek the remedy
of specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary
or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof.
