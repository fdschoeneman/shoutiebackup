        Information Collection and Use
      %p
        We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.
      %p
        %b Information Collected Upon Registration:
        When you create or reconfigure a Skygodlin account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.
      %p
        %b Additional Information:
        You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find Skygodlin users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.  Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.
      %p
        %b Reviews, Following, Lists and other Public Information:
        Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world.  Most of the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to make public.  This includes not only the Reviews and the metadata provided with Reviews, such as when you Reviewed, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, and many other bits of information.  Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public but we generally give you a settings page which you can access when logged in.
        to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For example, your public Reviews are searchable by many search engines to a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about all information that will be made public by Skygodlin, not just your Reviews.
      %p
        What you say on Skygodlin may be viewed all around the world instantly.

        %b Log Data:
        Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.
      %p
        %b Links:
        Skygodlin may keep track of how you interact with links in Tweets across our Services including third party clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
      %p
        %b Cookies:
        Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Skygodlin may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
      %p
        %b Third Party Services:
        Skygodlin uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics.  These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.
